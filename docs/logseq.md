- ## Customizations
	- Custom css for tags:
	- ```
	  /*Changing tags to have a blue button appearance and be nice and rounded */
	  - .tag{ padding:0 7px; border-radius:7px; margin:2px 0; color:white !important; background-color:#2883df}.content
	  ```
- ## My use a.k.a. what's working for me and what ain't
	- ### Things I like
		- Text backend is huge.  My data, I am in control - backups, replication, opening with other tools
		- My three main platforms for daily compute are supported - Windows, Android, IoS
		- Using the journal entries as the main entry point frees the mind from thinking about organization first.  Content first approach appeals to me.
		- I think it is making me capture more "rough" content for my future self to access and maybe organize or maybe just have available via search.
			- Ease of creating tags
	- ### Things I don't like (so far)
		- Blocks of text I want to paste in can't be edited.  This 'everything is an outline' approach is a double edged sword.
		- I don't know enough about the upcoming "database version" but I am concerned that it may corrupt the beauty and simplicity of "text files are the backend" philosophy.
		- Too many orphaned files seemingly from [[android]] replication is annoying.
		- Many of the articles highlighting what can be done with logseq focus on plugins.  My primary device is my ipad.  Plugins only work on the desktop app.
		- The roadmap and updates from the dev team seem sporadic at best.
